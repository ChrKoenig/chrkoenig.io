      <description>Island Biogeography My PhD work focused on the fascinating topic of island biogeography. The reason why biologists love to study islands is their geographic isolation. Emerging as sterile rocks from the ocean floor, islands are populated over long time spans by only those species that manage to cross the open sea. For the few species that succeed, a completely new environment &amp;ndash; typically with fewer competitors or predators &amp;ndash; awaits, leading to spectacular evolutionary shifts.</description>

      <title>Big Data Ecology</title>

      <description>Big Data Ecology Biodiversity science is transitioning into the age of Big Data, with massively expanding digital data collections and infrastructure. To keep pace with these developments, biodiversity researchers are increasingly adopting practices and tools from traditionally more technical fields such as informatics and data science. I developed and held this three-day workshop for the BioMove research training group in order to equip their graduate students with the skills necessary to make their work count in the age of big data ecology.</description>

      <title>Biodiversity Databases</title>

      <description>Biodiversity Databases I have led and contributed to the development of multiple biodiversity databases. During my PhD, I was one of two main developers behind GIFT, the Global Inventory of Floras and Traits database. GIFT provides information on the geographical distribution and biological characteristics (functional traits) of more than 300.000 plant species worldwide. More than 3.000 geographical regions ranging from small protected areas to entire countries are part of GIFT. GIFT is set up as MySQL database running on an Apache server, with the ETL pipeline being written in R.</description>

      <title>Web applications with R-Shiny</title>

      <description>Web applications with R-Shiny The Shiny R-package allows building interactive web application from R.
In an upcoming project, I will also use Shiny to build a file converter where users can upload vegetation data in various file formates, e.g. as .csv, .xslx or Turboveg database, and convert them into a exchange XML format defined by the VegX standard.

      <title>Bayesian Hierarchical Models</title>

      <description>Bayesian Hierarchical Models Bayes&#39; theorem provides a powerful way to incorporate uncertainty into statistical modeling. Two key differences set the Bayesian approach apart from classical frequentist statistics. First, the parameters of a model are treated as random instead of fixed variables, i.e. they are drawn from a probability distribution. This has substantial advantages when estimating complex models because the uncertainty surrounding model parameters can be propagated throughout the model. Second, Bayesian approaches take into account prior information about the distribution of a parameter.</description>
