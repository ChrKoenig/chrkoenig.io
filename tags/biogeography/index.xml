Emerging as sterile rocks from the ocean floor, islands are populated over long time spans by only those species that manage to cross the open sea. For the few species that succeed, a completely new environment &amp;ndash; typically with fewer competitors or predators &amp;ndash; awaits, leading to spectacular evolutionary shifts.</description>

      <description>Biodiversity Databases I have led and contributed to the development of multiple biodiversity databases. Specifically, I was one of two main developers behind GIFT, the Global Inventory of Floras and Traits database. GIFT provides information on the geographical distribution and biological characteristics (functional traits) of more than 300.000 plant species worldwide. Geographical regions in GIFT range from small protected areas to entire countries and are geostatistically processed to derive features related to, e.</description>
